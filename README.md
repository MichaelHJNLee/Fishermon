Press the 'Fish!' button to fish for a Pokémon. 
Click the indicated key to reel it in. 
When you catch a Pokémon, it will go into your bucket. 
You can sell your Pokémon to earn coins. 
Use your coins to unlock better rods, new lakes, or other regions. 
Better rods will pull better Pokémon and different lakes will hold different types of Pokémon.
If you're lucky you might even find a shiny!
